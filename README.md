The fatalities in construction sites have been a serious issue in India. On an average 38 (=11,614/300 working days in a year) fatal accidents occur per day in Indian construction sector.

I wanted to provide a comprehensive solution for this problem. So here's my new project "𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝗾𝘂𝗶𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻" using YOLO V8.

I created 7 objects ['boots', 'gloves', 'hard-hat', 'mask', 'person', 'ppe-suit', 'vest'] and trained the model with more than 1300+ images.

I converted the Pascal Visual object classes (xml) to YOLO V8 format (txt).

The accuracy of the model was pretty much good. I'm looking forward to add more training data and fine tune the model.
